# Super Castle

> An open mind is like a fortress with its gates unbarred and unguarded.

This is a game about building a castle. Magnificent and sempiternal, the fortress of the mind will rise â€” and it begins with a single block.

Set in the 13th century, *Super Castle* immerses you in a captivating medieval fantasy world of some description.

## How to play

- Arrow keys or WASD (and R to restart the level)
- Tap on the screen
- Gamepad left analog stick (and B to restart the level)

The icons are: toggle audio, restart the level, and level select.

For best experience on Android, use the 'Add to Home screen' feature. Seriously, it's amazing how much better the game runs if started from that shortcut.

Thank you for playing!
