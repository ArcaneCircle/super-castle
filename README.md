# Super Siege of Baghdad

In the heart of ancient Baghdad, a shining beacon of knowledge, the House of Wisdom, stands as a testament to the golden age of enlightenment. As the Mongol forces close in on the city in 1258, threatening to obliterate centuries of accumulated wisdom, one scholar embarks on a mission â€” wielding not a sword, but the power of sacred geometry.

Set in the 13th century, *Super Siege of Baghdad* immerses you in a world where geometry is more than an empirical science; it's a mystical force with the potential to change the course of history. Can you harness this power and save the House of Wisdom from its impending doom?
